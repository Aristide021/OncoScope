## 🔍 Quick Demo Path

### Option 1: Breast Cancer Case Study (Recommended)
1. **Run Demo**: `npm start` 
2. **Load File**: Upload `demo_mutations/breast_cancer_demo.txt`
3. **Watch Magic**: See OncoScope analyze 5 mutations in real-time

**This demonstrates our flagship capability:**
> *"These are real mutations from a breast cancer patient: EGFR, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, MET. Watch this. OncoScope analyzes these mutations together, understanding how they interact, which pathways converge, and what resistance patterns emerge. Two to five minutes on a standard laptop—no GPU, no cloud. Look at these results. Osimertinib for EGFR, but OncoScope sees the PIK3CA mutation too and recommends combination therapy with Alpelisib. It mapped the pathway convergence—KRAS enhancing PI3K signaling, MET synergizing with EGFR. Here, it's already warning about T790M resistance and recommending liquid biopsies now, not after relapse. This isn't pattern matching—this is systems biology."*

### Option 2: Quick Single Mutation
1. **Upload**: `demo_mutations/single_mutation.txt` (TP53 hotspot)
2. **See Speed**: <60 seconds for comprehensive analysis

### What to Notice:
- ✅ **Systems Biology**: Pathway convergence analysis (not just individual mutations)
- ✅ **Combination Therapy**: Osimertinib + Alpelisib recommendations  
- ✅ **Resistance Prediction**: T790M resistance warnings with liquid biopsy recommendations
- ✅ **Real-time Progress**: Watch clustering and AI analysis phases
- ✅ **Clinical Integration**: HGVS notation, professional reporting format
