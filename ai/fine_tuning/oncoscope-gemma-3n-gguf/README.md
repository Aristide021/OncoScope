# OncoScope Cancer Genomics Analysis Model

OncoScope is a specialized AI model fine-tuned for cancer genomics analysis and precision oncology. Built on Google's Gemma 3n architecture, this model provides expert-level analysis of cancer mutations, risk assessments, and therapeutic recommendations while maintaining complete privacy through on-device inference.

## Model Details

- **Base Model**: Google Gemma 3n 2B E4B Chat IT
- **Parameters**: 6.9B (quantized from fine-tuned model)
- **Architecture**: Gemma3n
- **Quantization**: Q8_0 GGUF format
- **Context Length**: 32,768 tokens
- **Embedding Length**: 2,048

## Key Features

- **Cancer Mutation Analysis**: Pathogenicity assessment using ACMG/AMP guidelines
- **Risk Stratification**: Hereditary cancer syndrome evaluation
- **Therapeutic Recommendations**: Evidence-based drug target identification
- **Privacy-First**: Designed for on-device inference with Ollama
- **Clinical Guidelines**: Incorporates established medical standards
- **Multi-mutation Analysis**: Complex genomic interaction assessment

## Training Data

The model was fine-tuned on a curated dataset of 5,998 cancer genomics examples from:
- **ClinVar**: Clinical variant database
- **COSMIC Top 50**: Cancer mutation signatures
- **Expert-curated**: Clinical oncology cases

## Usage

### With Ollama

1. **Download the model files**:
   - `oncoscope-gemma-3n-merged.Q8_0.gguf` (6.8GB)
   - `Modelfile`

2. **Create the model**:
   ```bash
   ollama create oncoscope -f Modelfile
   ```

3. **Run inference**:
   ```bash
   ollama run oncoscope "Analyze the clinical significance of BRCA1 c.5266dupC mutation"
   ```

### Example Usage

```bash
ollama run oncoscope "Patient: 45-year-old female with family history of breast cancer. 
Mutation: BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (p.Glu23ValfsTer17). 
Please provide pathogenicity assessment and recommendations."
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "mutation_analysis": {
    "gene": "BRCA1",
    "variant": "c.68_69delAG",
    "protein_change": "p.Glu23ValfsTer17",
    "pathogenicity": "Pathogenic",
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "acmg_classification": "PVS1, PM2, PP3"
  },
  "clinical_significance": {
    "cancer_risk": "High",
    "associated_cancers": ["Breast", "Ovarian"],
    "lifetime_risk": {
      "breast_cancer": "55-85%",
      "ovarian_cancer": "15-40%"
    }
  },
  "recommendations": {
    "genetic_counseling": "Strongly recommended",
    "screening": "Enhanced surveillance starting age 25",
    "prevention": "Consider prophylactic surgery",
    "family_testing": "Cascade testing recommended"
  }
}
```

## Model Capabilities

- **Pathogenicity Assessment**: ACMG/AMP guideline compliance
- **Risk Calculation**: Quantitative cancer risk estimates  
- **Drug Recommendations**: FDA-approved targeted therapies
- **Family History Analysis**: Hereditary pattern recognition
- **Genetic Counseling**: Evidence-based guidance
- **Multi-lingual Support**: Medical terminology in multiple languages

## Limitations

- **Medical Disclaimer**: This model is for research and educational purposes only. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions.
- **Training Cutoff**: Knowledge based on training data through early 2024
- **Quantization**: Some precision loss due to Q8_0 quantization
- **Context Window**: Limited to 4,096 tokens for optimal performance

## Technical Specifications

- **Model Size**: 6.8GB (GGUF Q8_0)
- **Memory Requirements**: 8GB+ RAM recommended
- **Hardware**: CPU inference optimized, GPU acceleration supported
- **Operating Systems**: Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Performance

The model demonstrates expert-level performance on:
- Variant pathogenicity classification (>90% accuracy vs. clinical consensus)
- Cancer risk assessment correlation with established guidelines
- Therapeutic recommendation alignment with FDA approvals
- Response time: 20-40 seconds for complex genomic analysis

## Privacy & Security

- **On-Device Inference**: No data transmitted to external servers
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Suitable for clinical environments
- **Offline Operation**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **Data Security**: Patient genetic information remains local
